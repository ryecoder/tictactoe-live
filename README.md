# Tic Tac Toe Live

A simple tic tac toe game. To play check out this wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe. Learned here more about object oriented programming using javascript. My code now looks cleaner. Learned about Modules (Single usage functions with public and private methods) and Factories (Multiple objects).

## Getting Started

As this is a simple web app it doesn't need any special installation. Just run the index.html file and web app will load.

### Prerequisites

Clone this repo, https://github.com/ryecoder/tictactoe-live,

```
git clone https://github.com/ryecoder/tictactoe-live
```

### Installing

I use Visual Studio code for coding and running a live server with hot reload. But you can run the index.html file on your browser and manually reload the browser if it is more preferred. To run in Visual Studio code.

Install this plugin in Visual Studio Code

```
Name: Live Server
Id: ritwickdey.liveserver
Description: Launch a development local Server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages
Version: 5.6.1
Publisher: Ritwick Dey
VS Marketplace Link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer

Once installed, open your repo clone folder. With the index.html file open, right click and then click run with live server.
